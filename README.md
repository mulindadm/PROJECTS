# INTRODUCTION
This analysis explores the impact of categorical factors (region, smoker status, and sex) on insurance charges . 

The ANOVA test was conducted to determine whether there are significant differences in insurance charges across different groups within each categorical variable. The results indicate:

Smoker status has the most substantial effect on insurance charges, with a highly significant difference between smokers and non-smokers.
Region and sex also show statistically significant differences, though their impact is relatively weaker compared to smoking.
This analysis helps in understanding the key factors influencing insurance costs and could be valuable for insurers and policymakers in risk assessment and pricing strategies.
